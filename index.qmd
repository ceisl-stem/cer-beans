## Introduction

> "Every little bean must be heard as well as seen!"
>
> --- Erich Maria Remarque, <cite>All Quiet on the Western Front</cite>

![A hill of important beans just waiting to be counted as imagined by Adobe Firefly](assets/hillofbeans2.jpg)

Quantitative measures capture only a small piece of the (bean) pie, but people
in academia ❤️ **love** ❤️ putting numbers on things and counting them (beans).

Rather than sitting back and stewing like a pot of vegetarian chili while fretting
about whether or not faculty committees and administrators will count the kinds of
beans I hope they would count, I decided to create my own set of beans for them to
count. Therefore:

**Community Engaged Research Broad Evaluation and Assessments with Nuanced Scores
(CER-BEANS)**[CER-BEANS is pronounced "Sir&nbsp;Beans."]{.aside}

I was inspired by the [Altmetric badge](https://www.altmetric.com/), so I want to
make sure to create a system of beans that is:

1. Easy to grok and nice to look at.[To [grok](https://www.britannica.com/topic/grok) something is to understand it intuitively and deeply.]{.aside}
2. Authentic and meaningful to the work and experiences of community engaged researchers.
3. Usable as a critical framing for the kind of work community engaged researchers
should be focusing on.
4. Translatable, transferable, robust, resilient, dynamic, and extensible.

How 'bout *these* beans?

![](assets/detailed_badge.png)

Pretty [*radicle,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicle) eh?

:::{.callout-note}

## If You Choose to Die on This Hill (of Beans)...

I am open to collaboration, dialogue, and disagreement. You can even
[open an issue](https://github.com/jeremyfprice/cer-beans/issues/new) if you'd
like to make it official. Contributions are welcomed, please read the 
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jeremyfprice/cer-beans/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Identifying the Metrics

> "You never cook onions with your beans. That's a recipe for tear gas."
>
> --- Justin Swapp, <cite>The Shadow's Servant</cite>

![An image of a medieval academic counting beans as imagined by Adobe Firefly](assets/beancounters3.jpg)

When evaluating community-engaged programs, it's important to consider various metrics that assess different aspects of the program's effectiveness and impact. CER-BEANS focuses on
*five areas,* or shall we say, *hills*, that are each comprised of *three components*.
Each of the components contribute to the individual area scores, each of which
contribute to the *overall* CER-BEANS score.

These areas that contribute to the overall CER-BEANS score are:

1. Participants
2. Engagement
3. Infrastructures
4. Outputs
5. Sustainability

Each of these areas and their components are described in some detail below. The
idea, the math, the concepts, are all licensed under a [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license[The code itself is licensed under an even more permissible MIT License]{.aside}, so you are welcome
to take these ideas and adapt them to your particular needs and preferences (as
long as you give credit where credit is due and share your adapted work alike).

:::{.callout-warning}

## If You Had a Roomful of Awards that Didn't Mean Beans...

It is important to remember a number, a score, or even a collection or bean hill
of scores or numbers, *do not tell the whole story* of your community engaged research.
This framework is provided to *help you tell that story* using a system that is
easily recognizable and considered a valid form of evidence.

These numbers are a guidepost for your readers--or more likely--your evaluators.

:::{.callout-tip}

## For Makers of Bean Stalks

Now that I've provided the warning, here are some tips for you to consider about
what CER-BEANS *does* provide for you as you construct a narrative around your work:

* It provides an overall *reflection* on your work and where you have focused your energies.
CER-BEANS gives you an indication of the impact your work has had, allowing you to
discuss your successes.
* It provides a *snapshot* of where you are in a longer process, what has
worked well so far, and where you will be focusing your efforts in the near future.
* It provides a rough *map* of where your and your collaborators, partners, and participants
can take the work moving forward.

## Participants

```{r participants-frame, echo = FALSE}
participants_frame <- data.frame(
  marginalized_proportions = c(
    "No Marginalized Participants",
    "A Few Marginalized Participants",
    "Some Marginalized Participants",
    "Just Under Half Marginalized Participants",
    "About Half Marginalized Participants",
    "Just Over Half Marginalized Participants",
    "Mostly Marginalized Participants",
    "Predominantly Marginalized Participants",
    "Nearly All Marginalized Participants",
    "All Marginalized Participants"
  ),

    0.75,
    0.85,
    0.9,
    0.95,
    1
  ))
gt(participants_frame)
```

### Number of Participants

How many participants involved? This is $p_n$. For this example, there are **6 participants**.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
number_of_participants <- 6
```

### Marginalized Proportions Score

How many of the participants represent and come from marginalized identities and
communities? This is $p_m$.

Also, are you working directly with these marginalized  participants, or are you
working with others (such as teachers or health care workers) who are working with
these identities and communities? 

It is up to your 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
marginalized_proportions_value <- 1
marginalized_proportions_coefficient <- 1
```

### Intersectionally Marginalized Score

```{r}
intersectionally_marginalized_value <- .95
intersectionally_marginalized_coefficient <- 1
# 0.85 indicates one degree away, e.g., students of teachers, while 1 indicates
# direct engagement
```

### Calculate Participation Score

<div style="text-align: center;">$p_s = p_n \times \frac{(\beta_m \times p_m) + (\beta_i \times p_i)}{2}$</div>
