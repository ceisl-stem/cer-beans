    "text": "Identifying the Metrics\n\n‚ÄúYou never cook onions with your beans. That‚Äôs a recipe for tear gas.‚Äù\n‚Äî Justin Swapp, The Shadow‚Äôs Servant\n\n\n\n\nAn image of medieval academics counting beans as imagined by Adobe Firefly\n\n\nWhen evaluating community-engaged programs, it‚Äôs important to consider various metrics that assess different aspects of the program‚Äôs effectiveness and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf You Had a Roomful of Awards that Didn‚Äôt Mean Beans‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember a number, a score, or even a collection or bean hill of scores or numbers, do not tell the whole story of your community engaged research. This framework is provided to help you tell that story using a system that is easily recognizable and considered a valid form of evidence.\nThese numbers are a guidepost for your readers‚Äìor more likely‚Äìyour evaluators.\n\n\nNow that I‚Äôve provided the warning, remember that academics are first and foremost makers of bean stalks: we are trained to make cases and construct narratives. Here are some tips for you to consider about what CER-BEANS does provide for you as you construct a narrative around your work:I make bean stalks, I‚ÄômA builder, like yourself.‚Äì Edna St.¬†Vincent Millay, The Bean-Stalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to Build Bean Stalks\n\n\n\n\nü™û Reflection: It provides an overall reflection on your work and where you have focused your energies. CER-BEANS gives you an indication of the impact your work has had, allowing you to discuss your successes.\nüì∏ Snapshot: It provides a snapshot of where you are in a longer process, what has worked well so far, and where you will be focusing your efforts in the near future.\nüó∫Ô∏è Map: It provides a rough map of where you and your collaborators, partners, and participants can take the work moving forward.\n\n\n\nCER-BEANS focuses on five categories and they each result in an category score. Each of the category scores contribute to the overall score. These are the five categories:\n\nParticipants\nEngagement\nInfrastructures\nOutputs\nSustainability\n\nEach of the category scores (\\(S_C\\)) follow a predictable pattern, that includes an impact number (\\(I_C\\)) that is amplified by a set of category component ratings (\\(R_C\\), individual ratings represented by \\(r_{C1} \\ldots r_C\\)). This is the general formula for a category score:\n\\[\nS_C = \\beta_CI_C \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sum r_{C_1} \\ldots r_{C_n}}{|R_C|}\\right)\n\\]\nThe process for computing each of the category scores is essentially calculating the average for the ratings in the category and then adding 1 to this average since the ratings are between 0 and 1 and only numbers greater than 1 will amplify things. The amplifier score is then multiplied by the impact number, which can be the number of participants, contact hours, institutional partners, etc.\nThe categories contribute to the overall score (\\(S_O\\)) as a straight-forward summation of all the category scores, where \\(s\\) represents the category scores, \\(x\\) represents the set of categories, and \\(n\\) is the number of categories:\n\\[\nS_O = \\sum_{C=1}^n s_C\n\\]\nThis overall score is similar to the Altmetric Attention Score in that it is a weighted count. The overall score increases\nEach of these categories and their components are described in some detail below.

    "title": "CER-BEANS: Community Engaged Research Balanced Expressions and Assessments with Nuanced Scores",
    "section": "Ripple Effects",
    "text": "Ripple Effects\nOne of the trickier elements to measure in community-engaged research are ‚Äúripple effects.‚Äù Because we are working in direct contact and cooperation with publics, we can assume that the work we do together has a broader impact than just the time we spend together. Ripple effects mapping is an excellent qualitative tool for capturing and understanding the ways in which participants‚Äô views and practices change through the cooperative work. It is, however, very difficult to distill into a quantitative metric.\nFor the purposes of these metrics, we use the number of people potentially impacted as a way to measure these ripple effects over a number of degrees of separation from the participants directly impacted.\nIt is understood that with each degree of separation, there is going to be a lessening of impact; the equation used to calcuate the Ripple Effect (\\(\\eta_r\\)) at each degree (\\(d_r\\)) includes both a decay constant (\\(\\lambda_r\\)), which is set to 0.55, and utilizes an inverse logarithmic function to calculate a reduction of impact over each degree.\n\\[\n\\eta_r =  \\lambda_r \\cdot \\frac{n_r}{\\log(d_r + 1)}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(n_r\\) represents the number of people potentially impacted by the community engaged work. This is divided by the logarithm of the degree of separation (\\(d_r\\)) and then multiplied by the decay constant (\\(\\lambda_r\\)), providing a ripple effect score (\\(\\eta_r\\)) at each degree of separation.The \\(\\log\\) of \\(d_r + 1\\) is calculated to avoid 0 in the denominator\nFor the Professional Development project, impact at each degree is determined this way:\n\nDirect Impact: 70 teachers participated in the Professional Development project.\n1 Degree of Separation: There are 522 students enrolled in the school, resulting in the likelihood that there will be some impact from the Professional Development.\n2 Degrees of Separation: The average family size in Indianapolis is 3.04 people. The potential family size, however, is assumed to be rounded up to 4 people in a family. This allows for ‚Äúnon-traditional,‚Äù non-normative, and more expansive family structures to be counted. This translates to potentially around 2,088 family members.\n\n\npdtg_ripple <- data.frame(\n  group = c(0, 1, 2),\n  group_name = c(\n    \"Teachers\",\n    \"Students\",\n    \"Family Members\"\n  ),\n  values = c(70, 522, 2088)\n)\n\nThe Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure is a much more complex project, even though it may directly involve fewer people. As delineated in the Participants section, there are a number of different categories of participants. Impact is also mapped out to a further degree given that it involves Teacher Education Students, so their future K-12 students need to be considered. Impact at each degree is determined in the following manner:\n\nDirect Impact: There are 50 participants directly involved in the project as outlined in the Participants section.\n1 Degree of Separation: The complexity of the project is clearly evident at this degree, as there are different connections that can be considered. Because the Teacher Education Students are involved in the school, we include the 388 students in the school. In addition, we include four family members for each Family Leader and Neighborhood Caucus Member, for a total of 36. We also assume approximately 100 members of Down Syndrome Indiana who may be reached at this degree. This results in potentially 524 people being impacted.\n2 Degrees of Separation: According to a survey of the Teacher Education Students, 80%, or 24 students, indicated that they were going to be continuing on the path to becoming a teacher. We can assume that each of these future teachers will have an average of 26.9 K-12 students in their classes in Indiana. This translates to a potential of 648 K-12 students per year.\n3 Degrees of Separation: Because this is a project that links and empowers families and educators to best support the learning of K-12 students, the last degree of separation involves the potential families of the future K-12 students. Four family members for 648 students potentially results in 2592 family members per year.\n\n\nfafi_ripple <- data.frame(\n  group = c(0, 1, 2, 3),\n  group_name = c(\n    \"Participants\",\n    \"Contemporaries\",\n    \"Future Students\",\n    \"Future Families\"\n  ),\n  values = c(50, 524, 648, 2592)\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe Professional Development project has a Ripple Effect Score of 1529. The ripple effect plot, based on a Vogel Spiral, looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure project has a Ripple Effect Score of 1818. The ripple effect plot looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that The Map is Not the Territory\n\n\n\nThis is a model, and while it is robust, it is still an estimation of the ripple effects of community-engaged research projects. It is important to provide accurate and well-reasoned numbers in the model, and it is important to capture different types of evidence to support a deep understanding of the impacts of this type of research."

For Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure, the participants consisted of the following:\n\n1 School Principal\n2 Institutional Leaders\n3 University Faculty and Staff (not part of the project team)\n4 Neighborhood Participants\n5 Family Leaders\n5 Cooperating Teachers\n30 Undergraduate Students\n\nThis is a total of 50 direct participants.\n\ntg_number_of_participants <- 70\nfafi_number_of_participants <- 50\nnumber_of_participants <- 7\n\n\n\nMarginalized Proportions Score\nWhat proportion of the participants represent and come from marginalized identities and communities? This is \\(p_m\\).\nYou can consider the direct population you are working with, or you can consider your target population who may be one degree removed when deciding on the \\(p_m\\) rating. If you consider your target, rather than direct, population, there is a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù or damping for doing so in the form of a marginalized proportions coefficient, \\(\\beta_m\\). If you are you working directly with the population, \\(\\beta_m\\) is 1, or no damping If you are working with, for example, teachers or health care workers who will work with your target population, then \\(\\beta_m\\) is 0.85 to dampen the score.\nFor the Professional Development project, the students in the school‚Äìthe actual target population‚Äìpredominantly represent marginalized identities and communities, so \\(p_m\\) is 0.9. The students are one degree away from the teachers, however, so \\(\\beta_m\\) is 0.85 to dampen the component score. For Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure, just over half of the participants represent marginalized identities and communities, so \\(p_m\\) is 0.75. We are considering this population directly (we can consider ripple effects later on) so \\(\\beta_m\\) is set to 1 so there is no damping of the score.\n\nstst_marginalized_proportions_value <- 1\nstst_marginalized_proportions_coefficient <- 1\ntg_marginalized_proportions_value <- 0.95\ntg_marginalized_proportions_coefficient <- 0.85\nfafi_marginalized_proportions_value <- 0.75\nfafi_marginalized_proportions_coefficient <- 1\n\n\n\nIntersectionally Marginalized Proportions Score\nWhat proportion of the participants represent and come from multiple and intersecting marginalized identities and communities? This is \\(p_i\\).\nJust like with the Marginalized Proportions Score, you can consider the direct population you are working with, or you can consider your target population. The Intersectionally Marginalized Coefficient, \\(\\beta_i\\), is the same as above. If you consider your target, rather than direct, population, \\(\\beta_i\\) is 0.85. If you are you working directly with the population, \\(\\beta_i\\) is 1.\nFor the Professional Development project, we will again be considering the intersectionality of the students in the school. Nearly all students represent marginalized identities and communities, so \\(p_i\\) is 0.9. The students are one degree away so \\(\\beta_i\\) is 0.85 to dampen the component score. For Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure, just over half of the participants represent marginalized identities and communities, so \\(p_m\\) is 0.75 and \\(\\beta_i\\) is set to 1.\n\nstst_intersectionally_marginalized_value <- 1\nstst_intersectionally_marginalized_coefficient <- 1\ntg_intersectionally_marginalized_value <- 0.95\ntg_intersectionally_marginalized_coefficient <- 0.85\nfafi_intersectionally_marginalized_value <- 0.75\nfafi_intersectionally_marginalized_coefficient <- 1\n\n\n\nCalculate Participant Component Score\nThe Participant Component Score is calculated through the following equation:\n\\[\np_s = p_n \\left( 1 + \\frac{(\\beta_m \\cdot p_m + \\beta_i \\cdot p_i)}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe find that the Professional Development Project has a Participant Index (\\(p_i\\)) of 0.81 (adjusted) and a full Participant Score (\\(p_s\\)) of 127. Family as Faculty as an Infrastructure has a Participant Index (\\(p_i\\)) of 0.75 and a Participant Score (\\(p_s\\)) of 88."
