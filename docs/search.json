You can even open an issue if you‚Äôd like to make it official. Contributions are welcomed, please read the Code of Conduct."

    "text": "Identifying the Metrics\n\n‚ÄúYou never cook onions with your beans. That‚Äôs a recipe for tear gas.‚Äù\n‚Äî Justin Swapp, The Shadow‚Äôs Servant\n\n\n\n\nAn image of medieval academics counting beans as imagined by Adobe Firefly\n\n\nWhen evaluating community-engaged programs, it‚Äôs important to consider various metrics that assess different aspects of the program‚Äôs effectiveness and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf You Had a Roomful of Awards that Didn‚Äôt Mean Beans‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember a number, a score, or even a collection or bean hill of scores or numbers, do not tell the whole story of your community engaged research. This framework is provided to help you tell that story using a system that is easily recognizable and considered a valid form of evidence.\nThese numbers are a guidepost for your readers‚Äìor more likely‚Äìyour evaluators.\n\n\nNow that I‚Äôve provided the warning, remember that academics are first and foremost makers of bean stalks: we are trained to make cases and construct narratives. Here are some tips for you to consider about what CER-BEANS does provide for you as you construct a narrative around your work:I make bean stalks, I‚ÄômA builder, like yourself.‚Äì Edna St.¬†Vincent Millay, The Bean-Stalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to Build Bean Stalks\n\n\n\n\nü™û Reflection: It provides an overall reflection on your work and where you have focused your energies. CER-BEANS gives you an indication of the impact your work has had, allowing you to discuss your successes.\nüì∏ Snapshot: It provides a snapshot of where you are in a longer process, what has worked well so far, and where you will be focusing your efforts in the near future.\nüó∫Ô∏è Map: It provides a rough map of where you and your collaborators, partners, and participants can take the work moving forward.\n\n\n\nCER-BEANS focuses on five categories and they each result in an category score. Each of the category scores contribute to the overall score. These are the five categories:\n\nParticipants\nEngagement\nInfrastructures\nOutputs\nSustainability\n\nEach of the category scores (\\(S_C\\)) follow a predictable pattern, that includes an impact number (\\(I_C\\)) that is amplified by a set of category component ratings (\\(R_C\\), individual ratings represented by \\(r_{C1} \\ldots r_C\\)). This is the general formula for a category score:\n\\[\nS_C = I_C \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sum r_{C_1} \\ldots r_{C_n}}{|R_C|}\\right)\n\\]\nThe process for computing each of the category scores is essentially calculating the average for the ratings in the category and then adding 1 to this average since the ratings are between 0 and 1 and only numbers greater than 1 will amplify things. The amplifier score is then multiplied by the impact number, which can be the number of participants, contact hours, institutional partners, etc.\nThe categories contribute to the overall score (\\(S_O\\)) as a straight-forward summation of all the category scores, where \\(s\\) represents the category scores, \\(x\\) represents the set of categories, and \\(n\\) is the number of categories:\n\\[\nS_O = \\sum_{x=1}^n s_x\n\\]\nThis overall score is similar to the Altmetric Attention Score in that it is a weighted count. The overall score increases\nEach of these categories and their components are described in some detail below.
